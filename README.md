This C++ calculator provides a range of functionalities, including manual input of mathematical equations, saving computed results into variables, retrieving values from a file for reuse, 
processing multiple equations stored in a file, and offering advanced scientific calculator functions, all managed through a structured menu, with an option to exit the program. This program was made as a project 
for the "OOP" subject in the faculty that I study in, CSIE.
